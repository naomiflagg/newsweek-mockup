# Newsweek Mockup

This mockup of Newsweek's homepage was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com) to practice using Bootstrap, as well as to experiment more with HTML and CSS.

The mockup can be viewed [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/newsweek-mockup/). Newsweek's homepage can be viewed [here](https://www.newsweek.com/). Please note that the site's content changes daily, so stories and page design may have changed since the mockup was created.
